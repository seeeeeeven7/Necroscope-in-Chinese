Prologue

序言

The hotel was big and rather famous, ostentatious if not downright flamboyant, within easy walking distance of Whitehall , and... not entirely what it seemed to be. Its top floor was totally given over to a company of international entrepreneurs, which was the sum total of the hotel manager's knowledge about it. The occupants of that unknown upper region had their own elevator at the rear of the building, private stairs also at the rear and entirely closed off from the hotel itself, even their own fire escape. Indeed they - 'they' being the only identific ation one might reasonably apply in such circumstances - owned the top floor, and so fell entirely outside the hotel's sphere of control and operation. Except that from the outside looking in, few would suspect that the building in total was anything other than what it purported to be; which was exactly the guise or aspect - or lack of such - which 'they' wished to convey.

这是一家著名的大酒店，即使用金碧辉煌也难以尽述其貌，从酒店出发短短数步便可来到白厅大街（英国政府所在）。但是它并不完全像它外表上体现出的那样，它的整个顶层都被一些国际企业家所开设的公司占据了，而这便是酒店经理所知的全部信息了。 这个未知的上层区域被它的占据者们在建筑物的后侧安装了单独的电梯、楼梯甚至还有消防通道，并且完全不对酒店本身开放。事实上，“他们”——在这种情况下唯一可以合理应用的称呼，完全拥有着顶层，彻底脱离了酒店的控制范围。从酒店的外表看来，很少人会怀疑这座建筑物会超脱其本身所表述的那些东西——这正是“他们”所希望传达的意图，或者说是“他们”所缺少的。

As for the 'international entrepreneurs' - whatever such creatures might be - 'they' were not. In fact they were a branch of Government, or more properly a subsidiary body. Government supported them in the way a tree supports a small creeper, but their roots were wholly separate. And similarly, because they were a very tiny parasite, the vast bulk of the tree was totally unaware of their presence. As is the case with so many experimental, unproven projects, their funding was of a low priority, came out of 'petty cash'. The upkeep of their offices was therefore far and away top of the list where costing was concerned, but that was unavoidable.

至于“国际企业家” - 无论这个辞藻描述的是什么 - “他们”其实并不是。 事实上，他们是政府的一个部门，或者说附属机构更合适。政府以树木支撑小爬虫的方式供养他们，但从根源上来说他们是完全分开的。同样的，因为他们是非常小的爬虫，所以树木的大部分躯干完全不知道他们的存在。就像许多未经证实的实验性项目一样，他们的资金是低优先级，来自“小钱”。因此，他们办公室的维护成本远远超过了成本核算清单中应当的数额，但这是不可避免的。

For unlike other projects, the nature of this one demanded a very low profile indeed. Its presence in the event of discovery would be an acute embarrassment; it would doubtless be viewed with suspicion and scorn, if not disbelief and downright hostility; it would be seen as a totally unnecessary expenditure, a needless burden on the taxpayer, a complete waste of public money. Nor would there be any justifying it; the benefits or fruits of its being remained as yet entirely conjectural and the mildest 'frost' would certainly put paid to them. The same principles apply to any such organisation or service: it must (a) be seen to be effective while paradoxically (b) maintaining its cloak of invisibility, its anonymity. Ergo: to expose such a body is to kill it...

与其他项目不同的是，这个项目的天然属性决定了它需要低调，出现在公众视野会使得事情变得十分尴尬。即使不报以彻底的不信任和敌意，它也会被怀疑和蔑视。它会被视为完全不必要的支出、纳税人不必要的负担和公帑的彻底浪费。或者说没有理由去做这样的事情，它的好处和成果仍然处于猜想阶段，所以即使最温和的情况下也会对它报以冷遇。这就是类似的组织或服务都面临的困境——首先它需要看起来是有效的，但是矛盾的是，它又需要隐藏起来、保持匿名，因为露出身躯就是自取灭亡。

Another way to dispose of this sort of hybrid would be, quite simply, to tear up its roots and deny it had ever existed. Or wait for them to be torn up by some outside agency and then fail to replant them.

对于这种矛盾体的一种处理方式是相当简单的——剥夺它的根源、否认它的存在，或者等待它被一些外部因素摧毁，并且无法复原。

Three days ago there had occurred just such an uprooting. A major tendril had been broken, whose principal function it had been to bind the vine to its host body, providing stability. In short, the head of the branch had suffered a heart attack and died on his way home. He had had a bad heart for years, so that wasn't strange in itself - but then something else had happened to throw a different light on the matter, something Alec Kyle didn't want to dwell on right now.

而三天前就发生了这样一件事情，部门的一条主干，一条用来附在宿主躯干上以提供稳定性的藤蔓被斩去了。简而言之，部门的主管者在回家的路上心脏病发作而死亡，他多年以来心脏不好，所以这并不奇怪——但是对于亚力克·凯尔来说，事情似乎即将变得更糟，而这并不是他想看到的。

For now, on this Monday morning of an especially chilly January, Kyle, the next in line, must assess the damage and feasibility of repairs; and if such repairs were at all possible, then he must make his first groping attempt to pull the thing back together. The project's foundations had always been a little shaky but now, lacking positive direction and leadership, the whole show might well fall apart in very short order. Like a sand-castle when the tide comes in.

现在，这个寒风凛冽的一月的周一上午，凯尔，目前的主管者，必须得评估目前状况的恶化程度以及修复的可行性。如果修复是可能的话，那么他必须首先尝试将事情拉回正轨。这个项目的基础一直有点不稳，但现在，缺乏明确的方向和领导，整个局面可能很快速地崩溃——就像浪潮之下的沙堡一样。

These were the thoughts in Kyle's head as he stepped from the slushy pavement through swinging glass doors into a tiny foyer, shook damp snow from his overcoat and turned the collar down. It was not that he personally had any doubt as to the validity of the project - in fact the opposite applied: Kyle believed the branch to be all- important -but how to defend his position in the face of all that scepticism from above? Scepticism, yes. Old Gormley had been able to pull it off, with all his friends in high places, his 'old school tie' image, his authority and enthusiasm and sheer get-up-and-go, but men such as Keenan Gormley were few and far between. Even fewer now.

这便是凯尔从泥泞的路面经由摆动的玻璃门进入一个小门厅时脑中的想法，随后他从大衣上将潮湿的雪摇落，衣领也拉了下来。凯尔并不是对这个项目的有效性存疑——相反他认为这个项目非常重要，但是对于上层的怀疑时，他该如何捍卫自己的立场？是的，怀疑。老戈姆利之前总是能搞定这一切，他有许多身处高位的朋友，他的“老派领带”形象，他的权威、热情和纯粹的快乐，但是基恩·戈姆利这样的人很少，而且越来越少了。

And this afternoon at four o'clock Kyle wouldbe called upon to defend his position, the validity of his branch's being, its very existence. Oh, they'd been quick off the mark, right enough, and Kyle believed he knew why. This was it, the crunch. With nothing to show for five years' work, the project was to be terminated. No matter what arguments he produced, he'd be shouted down. Old Gormley had been able to shout louder than all of them put together; he'd had the clout, the back-up; but Alec Kyle - who was he? In his mind's eye, he could picture the afternoon's inquisition right now:

这个下午的四点钟，凯尔需要保卫其立场——这个部门存在的有效性还有它的存在本身。噢，它们就要离他而去了。凯尔相信他知道为什么——必要的紧缩。历经五年的工作，却没有任何可展示的东西，这部门即将终结与此。无论他给出什么样的论据，无论他如何大喊大叫，都无济于事。老戈姆利倒是能比其他人喊得都大声，因为他有影响力，有支持。但是亚力克·凯尔，他又是谁？对他来说，下午的审判仿佛已在眼前。

'Yes, Minister, I'm Alec Kyle. My function in the Branch? Well, apart from being second in command to Sir Keenan, I was - I mean I am - er, that is to say, I prognosticate ... I beg your pardon? Ah, it means I foresee the future, sir. Er, no, I have to admit that I probably couldn't give you the winner of the 3:30 at Goodwood tomorrow. My awareness generally isn't that specific. But -'

“是的，部长，我是亚力克·凯尔。我在部门里的职能？额，除了对基恩爵士报告之外，我是——我的意思是我是，呃，那就是说，我能够预言...您说什么？啊，这意味着我能够预见未来，先生。呃，不，我不得不承认，我可能不能给你古德伍德（英国西萨塞克斯郡的一个赛马场）明天3点30分场的优胜者。我的结论一般不是具体的。但是……”

But it would be hopeless! A hundred years ago they wouldn't accept hypnotism. Only fifteen years ago they were still laughing at acupuncture. So how could Kyle hope to convince them in respect of the branch and its work? And yet, on the other hand, coming through all the despondency and sense of personal loss, there was this other thing. Kyle knew it for what it was: his 'talent', telling him that all was not lost, that somehow he would convince them, that the branch would go on. Which was why he was here: to go through Keenan Gormley's things, prepare some sort of case for the branch, continue fighting its cause. And again Kyle found himself wondering about his strange talent, his ability to glimpse the future.

但是这是毫无希望的，一百年前他们就不接受催眠的存在，十五年前他们开始嘲笑针灸，那么凯尔怎能寄希望于说服他们部门的存在和它的功能？然而，从另一个角度来说，除开这些沮丧和个人损失的情绪，还有一件事情，凯尔知道它是什么——他的“天赋”，告诉他所有东西都不会失去，不知何故他最终说服了他们，部门会继续下去。这就是他在这里的原因，在基恩·戈姆利的这些事务中走过场，为部门准备一些“案例”，从而继续奋斗其事业。并且凯尔发现他又开始好奇他的天赋，他能够遇见未来的能力。

For the fact was that last night he had dreamed that the answer lay right here, in this building, amongst Gormley's papers. Or perhaps 'dreamed' was the wrong word for it. Kyle's revelations - his glimpses of things which had not yet happened, future occurrences -invariably came in those misty moments between true sleep and coming awake, immediately prior to full conscious awareness. The clamour of his alarm-clock could do it, set the process in motion, or even the first crack of sunlight through his bedroom window. That's what it had been this morning: the grey light of another grey day invading his room, getting under his eyelids, impressing upon his idly drifting mind the fact that another day was about to be born.

事实是，昨天晚上他梦见答案就在这里，在这栋建筑当中，在戈姆利的文档中。也许不应当说梦见，凯尔的启示——他瞥见未发生的事情，未来的碎片——在真正的睡眠和即将到来的清醒之间，会在迷雾中出现。闹钟的喧嚣可以做到这一点，只需简单的设定一下，甚至通过卧室窗口照进的第一缕曙光亦可。这就是今早所发生的事情，一个灰色的一天所照进的第一缕灰色的光线，入侵他的房间，在他的眼皮下面，在他懒散的脑海中，印下了这即将开始的一天。

And with it had been born a vision. But again, 'glimpse' might be a better word for it, for that wasall Kyle's talent had ever permitted: the merest glimpse. Knowing this - and knowing that it would only occur once and then be gone forever - he had fastened upon it. absorbed it. He dared not miss a thing. Everything be had ever 'seen' in this way had always proved to be vitally important.

而且它生出了一个景象。或者“瞥见”可能是一个更好的词，因为凯尔的天赋所允许仅仅是瞥见。他知道这一点，知道它只会发生一次，然后永远消失，所以他坚持着，吸收着，他不敢错过任何事情。过去那些以如此方式被“看到”的事情都证明了这是至关重要的。

And on this occasion:

在这个场合当中：

He had seen himself seated at Keenan Gormley's desk, going through his papers one by one. The top right-hand desk drawer was open; the papers and files on the desk in front of him had come from there. Gormley's massive security filing cabinet stood as yet undisturbed against the wall of his office; its three keys were lying on top of the desk where Kyle had tossed them. Each key would open a tiny drawer in the cabinet, and each drawer had its own combination lock. Kyle knew the combinations and yet had not bothered to open the cabinet. No, for that which he sought was right here, in these documents from the drawer.

他看到自己坐在基恩·戈姆利的办公桌上，一张一张的阅览他的文件。右上角书桌的抽屉开着，他桌子上的这些文件正是源自那里。戈姆利的大型安全文件柜静静的嵌在墙上，它的三把钥匙被凯尔扔在桌子上，每把钥匙都可以打开文件柜的一个小抽屉，每个抽屉内都有一个组合锁，凯尔知道这些组合锁的密码，但是并没有尝试去打开柜子。是的，他所寻求的东西不在那而在他面前，在这些从抽屉中拿出的文档中。

As if realisation of that fact had galvanised the image of himself where it sat in Gormley's chair, Kyle had then seen himself pause abruptly as he came to a certain file. It was a yellow file, which meant that it concerned a prospective member of the organisation. Someone 'on the books', as it were. Someone Gormley had had his beady eye on. Perhaps someone with a real talent.

对这一事实的充分认知激起了自己坐在戈姆利椅子上形象的反映，凯尔看到自己暂时停下来，停在了一份特定的文档上。这是一份黄色的文档，这意味着它涉及组织的潜在人员。可以这么说，一个“只在书上”的人。这是一个戈姆利关注着的人，或许，一个拥有真正天赋的人。

As that thought dawned, so Kyle took a step towards himself where he sat. Then, dramatically, as was always the case, his alter-image at the desk had looked up, stared at him, and held up the file so that he could read the name on the cover. The name was 'Harry Keogh'.

随着这个想法的出现，凯尔向坐着的自己走进了一步。然后，情理之外却在意料之中的，桌后的另一个自己抬起了头，看着他，然后举起了档案，所以凯尔能够看清楚封面上的名字，“哈里·凯格”。

That was all. That had been the point where Kyle had started awake. As to what the thing had meant or was supposed to signify - who could say? Kyle had long since given up trying to predict the meaning of these glimpses, other than the fact that they had meaning. But in any case, if something could be said to have brought him here today, it would have to be that brief and as yet inexplicable 'dream' before waking.

这便是所有了，在这一刻凯尔已经开始清醒了。所以这到底意味着什么，或者想要表示什么——谁知道呢？凯尔早已放弃了试图预测这些瞥见的意义，除了它们本身即将发生的事实。但无论如何，如果可以说今天有什么把他带到了这里，那么在从这个无法解释的“梦中”再次醒来之前，一切都会如那个瞥见一般简单。

As yet it was still fairly early in the morning. Kyle had beaten the first rush of heavy traffic in London's streets by just a few minutes. For the next hour or more all would be chaos out there, but in here it was quiet as the proverbial tomb. The rest of the admin team (all three of them, including the typist!) had been given today and tomorrow off out of respect for the dead man, so the offices upstairs would be completely empty.

现在还是非常早的清晨，凯尔已经在伦敦的街道上提前避开了第一次交通高峰期，但是也仅提前了几分钟而已。在接下来的一个小时或更多的时间里，所有的事情都会陷入混乱当中。但是在这里，它就像谚语里一样安静。管理层的其余人员（包括打字员在内的全部三人）已经在今天和明天都被放了假——给予死者的尊重，所以顶层的办公室空无一人。

In the tiny foyer Kyle had pressed the button for the elevator, which now arrived and opened its doors. He entered and as the doors closed behind him he took out his pass-card, sliding it easily and smoothly through the sensor slot. The elevator jerked but made no upward movement. Its doors opened, waited for a long moment, closed again. Kyle frowned, glanced at his card and silently cursed. It had run out yesterday! Normally Gormley would have renewed its validity on the branch computer; now Kyle would have to do it himself. Fortunately he had Gormley's card with him, along with the rest of his office-related effects. Using the ex-Head of Branch's pass-card, he coerced the elevator into carrying him to the top floor, going through a similar procedure to let himself into the main suite of offices.

在狭小的门厅中，凯尔按下了电梯的按钮，电梯随即到达并打开了门。他进了门，门在他身后关上，他拿出了他的通行卡，轻松顺利地滑过传感器槽。电梯振动了一下，但没有向上移动。它的门打开了，等待了很长时间后再次关上。凯尔皱着眉头，看着他的卡片默默诅咒。昨天用完了！通常，戈姆利会在部门的电脑上更新其有效次数，但是现在凯尔只能自己动手。幸运的是，他带着戈姆利的卡片，以及其余和他办公室有关的事务。他使用前任主管者的通行证，让电梯将他带到顶层，并通过类似的程序使自己得以进入主办公室。

The silence inside was almost deafening. High up above the level of the street, with soundproofed floors to shut out hotel noises from below and double-glazed, tinted windows for additional privacy, the place seemed set in a sort of vacuum. The feeling crept in that if you listened to that silence long enough, it would become hard to breathe. It was especially so in Gormley's room, where someone had been thoughtful enough to draw the blinds at the windows. But the blinds had jammed only a little more than half-way shut, so that now, with bands of light coming in through the green-tinted windows, the entire office seemed decorated in a horizontal, sub-marine pinstripe. It made this once familiar room strangely alien, and it was suddenly very odd and unreal not to have the Old Man here...

这其中的沉默震耳欲聋，远离街道的高度，阻挡下方酒店噪音的隔音地板，保护隐私的双层涂色玻璃窗，这个地方似乎坐落于真空当中。这感觉如此之深，如果你听了足够长时间的沉默，就会变得难以呼吸。在戈姆利的房间里更是如此，因为有人在深思熟虑之下将百叶窗也拉了下来。但是百叶窗只有拉下来了一半，所以光线通过绿色的窗户进入，将整个办公室淹没在一些水平的细条纹当中。它使这个曾经熟悉的房间变得异常陌生，而且那位老人的缺席更是使得这一切非常奇怪和虚幻...

Kyle stood in the doorway, staring into the office for long moments before entering. Then, closing the door behind him, he stepped to the centre of the room. Several hidden scanners had already picked him up and identified him, in the outer offices as well as in here, but a monitor screen in the wall close to Gormley's desk wasn't satisfied. It beeped and printed up:

凯尔站在门口，长时间盯着办公室，然后走了进来。他带上身后的门，走到房间的中心。几个隐藏的扫描仪早已在办公室外和这里发现了他，并识别出了他，但戈姆利办公桌旁的一个监视器屏幕对此并不满足，它哔哔响起并打印出来一段文字：

SIR KEENAN GORMLEY IS NOT AVAILABLE AT PRESENT. THIS IS A SECURE AREA. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF IN YOUR NORMAL SPEAKING VOICE, OR LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU FAIL TO LEAVE OR IDENTIFY YOURSELF, A TEN SECOND WARNING WILL BE GIVEN, FOLLOWING WHICH THE DOOR AND WINDOWS WILL LOCK AUTOMATICALLY... REPEAT: THIS IS A SECURE AREA.

“基恩·戈姆利先生目前不在。这是安全区域。请使用您正常的说话语音标识自己，或者立刻离开。如果以上措施均未达成，一段倒数十秒的警报将响起，在这之后窗户和门都将被自动锁上……重复：这是安全区域。”

Feeling irrationally aggressive towards the cold, unthinking machine, and not a little perverse, Kyle said nothing but waited. After a count of three the screen wiped itself clean and printed up:

抱着对这冰冷而无法思考机器的一些较劲情绪，凯尔什么也没有说，而是等待着。在三次重复之后，屏幕擦除掉了所有内容并重新打印：

TEN SECOND WARNING COMMENCES NOW... TEN... NINE... EIGHT... SEVEN ... SIX ...

开始10秒倒计时警告……10……9……8……7……6……

'Alec Kyle,' said Kyle grudgingly, not wishing to be locked in.

“亚力克·凯尔”凯尔勉强说道，他可不希望被锁起来。

The machine recognised his voice pattern, stopped counting, commenced a new routine:

机器识别出了他的声音模式，停止了计数，开始了一段新的流程

GOOD MORNING, MR KYLE... SIR KEENAN GORMLEY IS NOT -

“早上好，凯尔先生，基恩·戈姆利先生现在不 - ”

'I know,' said Kyle. 'He's dead.' He stepped to the desk keyboard and punched in the current security override; to which the machine replied:

“我知道，”，凯尔说道：“他死了”。他走近了桌子上的键盘，并在当前的安全控制程序中敲击着。而机器回复道：

DO NOT FORGET TO RE-SET BEFORE YOU LEAVE, and switched itself off.

不要忘记在离开之前重设系统。然后就将自己关掉了。

Kyle sat down at the desk. Funny world, he thought. And, funny bloody outfit! Robots and romantics. Super science and the supernatural. Telemetry and telepathy. Computerised probability patterns and precognition. Gadgets and ghosts!

凯尔坐在了桌子旁。有趣的世界，他想道。而这是一个多么有趣的机构！机器人和浪漫主义，超级科学和超自然，遥测和心灵感应，计算机概率模式和预认识，什么鬼东西！

He reached into a pocket for his cigarettes and lighter, came out with both items and also the keys to Gormley's security cabinet. Without thinking, he tossed the keys on to an empty corner of the desk. Then he paused and stared at them lying there, forming a pattern - the pattern from this morning's glimpse into the future. Very well, let's go from there.

他伸进口袋拿出了他的香烟和打火器，但是随之而出的还有戈姆利的安全柜钥匙。他想也没想的就将钥匙仍在了桌子的空角上。然后他停了下来，看着它们躺在那里，形成了一个特定形状——他今早所“瞥见”的未来中的那个形状。很好，那么就从这里开始吧。

He tried the drawers of the desk. Locked. He took out Gormley's notebook from the inside pocket of his overcoat, checked the code. It was OPEN SESAME.

他试了试桌子的抽屉，锁上了。他从大衣的内侧口袋中取出了戈姆利的笔记本，找到了密码：“芝麻开门”。

Unable to suppress a chuckle, Kyle punched OPEN SESAME into the desk keyboard and tried again. The top right-hand drawer slid open at a touch. Inside, papers, documents, files...

然而凯尔却笑不出来，他在桌上的键盘输入密码并重新尝试打开抽屉，最右上角的抽屉一碰便滑了出来，在里面是各式的纸张、文档和文件……

And here comes the funny bit, he thought.

有意思的部分来了，他想道。

He took out the papers and placed them in front of him on the desk. Leaving the drawer open (his 'glimpse' again), he began to check through the documents, placing each one back in the drawer in its turn. He knew that by now his talent shouldn't really surprise him any more, but it always did - and so he gave a small involuntary start as he arrived at the yellow file. The name on the cover was, of course, Harry Keogh.

他拿出文件把它们放在桌子前面，并让抽屉就那么开着（他的“瞥见”中描述的那样），他开始检查这些文件，并将它们依次放回到抽屉当中。他知道现在他的天赋不应该再让他感到惊讶了，但每次总会这样，正如他最终发现了那份黄色档案时自然而然升起的感觉一样。那封面上的名字，当然，哈里·凯格。

Harry Keogh. Apart from Kyle's dream, that name had only ever come up once before: in an ESP game he had used to play with Keenan Gormley. As for this file: he had never seen it before in his life (his conscious life, anyway) and yet here he sat staring at it, exactly as in his dream. It was a very creepy feeling. And -

哈里·凯格。除开凯尔的梦中，这个名字只在之前出现过一次，那是他曾经和基恩·戈姆利玩过的一局ESP游戏（超感觉游戏）当中。而这份文件，他在他之前的生活中从未见过（他的现实生活中），而他现在坐着盯着它，就像他的梦中一样。这是一种非常令人毛骨悚然的感觉。

In the dream he had held the file up to himself. Now the thought set the act in motion. Feeling foolish - not understanding why he did it, but at the same time feeling his skin charged with alien energy - he held up the file to the empty room, as if to a ghost from his own recent past. And just as a thought had triggered the action, now the action triggered something else - something away and beyond all of Alec Kyle's previous experience or knowledge.

在梦中，他曾将档案展现给了自己。而现在，这个想法促使着他做出那样的动作。虽然感到愚蠢，也不知道为什么要这样做，但是他的皮肤仿佛被奇怪的能量驱使着，于是他将档案举起展现给面前空空如也的房间，仿佛展现给他过去的灵魂一般。正如一个想法促使了他现在的行为，他现在的行为也触发了一些别的什么，一些远超越亚力克·凯尔之前所经历过和所知的东西。

God almighty! Gadgets and ghosts!

全能的神啊！这是什么鬼玩意！

The room had been comfortably warm just a moment ago. Centrally heated, the offices were never cold. Or should not be. But now, in a matter of seconds, the temperature had plunged. Kyle knew it, could feel it, but at the same time he retained enough of instinctive reasoning to wonder if perhaps his own body temperature had also taken a tumble. If so, it wouldn't be hard to explain. This must be what shock felt like. No wonder people shivered!

这房间刚刚还是温暖舒适的，这是因为中央供暖的缘故，办公室从来不冷，也不应该冷。但是现在，就在这几秒钟之内，气温迅速的下降。凯尔知道这一点是因为他切身感受到了，不过他仍然保持了足够的理智，他想知道自己的体温是否也下降了。即使下降了，这也并不奇怪，因为他被震惊笼罩着，难怪人们在震惊时总会颤抖！

'Jesus Christ!' he whispered, his breath pluming in the suddenly frigid air. The file fell from his twitching fingers, slapped down on the desk. The sound of its falling - that and what he saw - galvanised Kyle into an almost spastic reaction of motion. He jerked back in his chair, causing its legs to ride through the pile of the carpet, tilting it backwards until it slammed against the window sill and rebounded.

“天呐！”他低声呢喃道，呼吸在骤冷的空气中流动。他的手指颤抖着，以致于文件从他的指缝中落下，摊落在桌子上。而这坠落的声音，以及他所看到的东西，使得他近乎痉挛。他猛地坐回了椅子上，使得椅腿跨过了一堆地毯，整个椅子都向后倾斜，直到撞到了窗台上并反弹了回来。

The - apparition? - the thing, where it stood half-way between the door and the desk, hadn't moved. At first Kyle had thought (and had dreaded the thought) that it could only be himself he saw standing there, somehow projected forward from the dream. But now he saw that it was someone - something - else. Not once did it enter his mind to question the reality of what he was seeing, and not for a moment did he consider it to be anything other than supernatural. How could it be anything else? The scanners where they constantly swept the room, the entire suite of offices, had detected nothing. Entirely independent, if they had picked up anything at all intruder buzzers would be going off right now, and getting louder by the minute until someone sat up and took notice. But the alarms were silent. Ergo, there was nothing here to scan - and yet Kyle saw it.

这是，幻影？那个站在门和桌子中间的的东西，并没有移动。起初，凯尔以为（并为这样的想法感到害怕）这是过去的自己，不知何故从过去的梦中出现。但是现在他看到的却是别的什么人，或者说别的什么东西。他从未质疑过他所看到的东西的真实存在，但他也不认为这东西是正常存在的事物。怎么可能呢？房间里的扫描器仍在扫描着整个房间，但是整个办公室里却什么都没有被侦测到。报警系统是独立工作的，如果他们检测到任何的入侵可能，所有的入侵警报都会立刻响起，并且随着时间变得越来越大直到有人过来进行处理。 但是现在，警报器都安安静静的，这意味着这里没有扫描到任何东西，但是凯尔却看到了。

It, he, was a man - a youth, anyway - naked as a baby, standing there facing Kyle, looking directly at him. But his feet weren't quite touching the carpeted floor and the bars of green light from the windows penetrated into his flesh as if it had no substance at all. Damn it - it had no substance at all! But the thing stared at him, and Kyle knew that it saw him. And in the back of his mind he asked himself: Is it friendly, or - ?

它，他，是一个男人，一个年轻的，呃，裸着身子的男人站在那里，面朝着凯尔，直直的看着他。但是他的脚实际上并没有接触到地面，而从窗户缝隙中照进的斑斓绿光直直的透过了他的身体——仿佛那根本没有东西一样，该死的！那里根本就没有东西！但是当那东西看着他的时候，凯尔知道它在看着他，而在他内心深处不停回响着一个问题，它是友好的，还是？

Inching his chair forward again, his eyes spied some&shy;thing in the back of the open drawer. A Browning 9mm automatic. He'd known Gormley carried a weapon but hadn't known about this one. But would the gun be loaded, and if it was would it be any good against this?

他将椅子缓缓朝前移回，他的眼睛盯着开着的抽屉里内部的一个东西——一把9mm自动勃朗宁手枪。 他知道戈姆利持有一把武器，但是对这一把却毫无所知，这枪是否上膛了？就算是，它又能否对抗眼前的不知何物？

'No,' said the naked apparition with a slow, almost imperceptible shake of its head. 'No it wouldn't.' Which was all the more surprising because its lips didn't move by the smallest fraction of an inch!

“不能，”赤裸的幻影缓缓说道，并难以察觉的摇了摇头：“它对我毫无用处。” 令人惊奇的是，它的嘴唇始终没有动过一丝一毫。

'Jesus Christ!' Kyle gasped again, out loud this time, as he once more gave an involuntary start away from the desk. And then, controlling himself, to himself, he said:

“天呐！”凯尔喘息道，这一次格外大声，并且开始不由自主的再次远离桌子。随即他控制住了自己，并在自己的意识里说道：

You ... you read my mind!

你……你阅读了我的思想。

The apparition smiled a thin smile. 'We all have our talents, Alec. You have yours and I have mine.'

幻影浅笑道：“我们都拥有各自的天赋，亚力克。你有你的，而我也有我的。”

Kyle's lower jaw, already agape, now fell open. He wondered which would be easier: to simply think at the thing or to talk to it.

凯尔的下巴早已蓄势待张，而现在已完全跌开。他不禁想到，与这幻影进行交流，是简单的思考还是说出来会比较简单。

'Just talk to me,' said the other. 'I think that will be easier for both of us.'

“直接说出来吧，”幻影说道：“这对我们来说都更为简单。”

Kyle gulped, tried to say something, gulped again and finally gasped out: 'But who... what... what the hell are you?'

凯尔咽了咽口水，尝试着说些什么，随后又咽了咽，最终说道：“但是，你是……什么……鬼东西？”

'Who I am doesn't matter. What I have been and will be does. Now listen, I've a lot to tell you and it's all rather important. It will take some time, hours maybe. Do you need anything before I begin?'

“我是谁并不重要，我的来处和去处才是问题的关键。现在听着，我有很多重要的事情要告诉你。这可能会花上一些时间，也许几个小时吧。在我开始之前你需要些什么吗？”

Kyle stared hard at the ... whatever it was. He stared at it, jerked his eyes away from it, peered at it out of the corner of his eye. It was still there. He surrendered to instinct backed up by at least two of his five senses, those of sight and hearing. The thing seemed rational; it existed; it wanted to talk to him. Why him and why now? Doubtless he'd shortly be finding out. But - God damn! -he wanted to talk to it, too. He had a real live ghost here, or a real dead one!

凯尔用力的凝视着……那不知什么东西。他将目光移开，试图用余光观察它，但是它仍在在那。他放弃了对他五感中至少两种——视觉和听觉的相信。这东西看起来似乎是合理的，它实际存在着，并且想要与他说话。为什么是他，为什么是现在？他感觉自己短时间内是弄不清楚了。 但是，该死的，他想要和它交流。 毕竟这是一个真实存在的鬼魂，一个真实的死着。

'Need anything?' he shakily repeated the other's question.

“需要些什么？”他颤抖着重复着幻影的问题。

'You were going to light a cigarette,' the apparition pointed out. 'You might also like to take your coat off, get yourself a coffee.' It shrugged. 'If you do these things first, then we can get on with it.'

“你需要点燃一支香烟，”幻影指出：“你也许需要脱下你的大衣，并且给自己弄上一杯咖啡。”它耸了耸肩，继续道：“如果你先做这些，我们就可以更好的继续下去。”

The central heating had come on, turning itself up a notch to compensate for the sudden fall in temperature. Kyle carefully stood up, took off his overcoat and folded it over the back of his chair. 'Coffee,' he said. 'Yes - er, I'll just be a moment.'

中央供暖默默的提高了一个档位，用以弥补突然的温度下降。 而凯尔也小心翼翼的站了起来，脱下了他的外套，并将其折叠起来放在了椅背上。“咖啡，”他说道：“是的，呃，我需要一小会。”

He walked round the desk and past his visitor. It turned to watch him leave the room, a pale shadow of a thing floating there, skinny, insubstantial as a snowflake, a puff of smoke. And yet...oh, yes, there was a power in it. Kyle was thankful it didn't follow him...

他绕过桌子，从拜访者身边穿过。它转过身来看着他走出房间，漂浮在那里的苍白阴影，显得消瘦，像雪花和烟雾那般没有实质。 但是，你可以感觉出其中存在的力量。 凯尔在心里默默感谢它没有跟过来。

He put two five-pence pieces in the coffee machine in the main office, fumbling the coins into the slot, and headed for the gents' toilet before the machine could deliver. He quickly relieved himself, picked up his steam&shy;ing paper cup of coffee on the way back to Gormley's office. The thing was still there, waiting for him. He carefully walked round it, seated himself again at the desk.

他掏出两个五便士硬币，来到主办公室的咖啡机旁，摸索着将硬币放入到插槽当中，然后朝洗手间走去——机器需要一会时间来处理。 他很快的释放了自己，随后回到咖啡机旁拿起了冒着热气的纸杯，走回了戈姆利的办公室。那个东西仍然在那里，等待着他，他小心翼翼的绕过了它，重新坐在了办公桌后。

And as he lit a cigarette he looked at his visitor more closely, in greater detail. This was something he had to get fixed in his mind.

随后他点起了一根香烟，并坐近了他的拜访者，这样他就能够看得更仔细——更多的细节，这是他必须映在自己脑海中的东西。

Taking into account the fact that its feet weren't quite touching the floor, it must be about five-ten in height. If its flesh was real instead of milky mist, it - or he - would weigh maybe nine stone. Everything about him was vaguely luminous, as if shining with some faint inner light, so Kyle couldn't be sure about colouring. His hair, an untidy mop, seemed sandy. Faint and irregular marks on his high cheeks and forehead might be freckles. He would be, oh, maybe twenty-five years old; he had looked younger at first but that effect was wearing off now.

抛开它的脚并没有着地的事实，它的高度大概有5英尺10英寸的样子。 如果它的躯体是实体而不是牛奶般的迷雾的话，它或者说他的体重大概9英石。 他身上的一切都在模糊的发着光，似乎是从内部中照射出的微弱光芒，所以凯尔不能确定其具体的颜色。 他的发型是一个不太整齐的拖把头，看起来像沙堆一样。 他有着高高的脸颊和额头，上面带着微弱和不规则的痕迹——可能是雀斑。他或许，哦，大概只有25岁的样子，第一印象他可能会显得更年轻，但是随后的一些痕迹会将结论推后。

His eyes were interesting. They looked atKyle and yet seemed to look right through him, as if he were the ghost and not the other way about. They were blue, those eyes - that startlingly colourless blue which always looks so unnatural, so that you think the owner must be wearing lenses. But more than that, there was that in those eyes which said they knew more than any twenty-five-year-old had any right knowing. The wisdom of ages seemed locked in them, the knowledge of centuries lay just beneath the faintly blue film which covered them.

他的眼睛非常有意思，它们看着凯尔，并且似乎透过了他，像他才是那个鬼魂一样。 那是一双蓝色的眼睛，是那种令人惊艳的无神蓝色，看起来非常不自然，令人不由自主的认为那一定是隐形眼镜什么的。 但是那眼神却在仿佛在告诉人们，眼睛之后的人实际上比一个正常的25岁的人知道的更多。 年龄带来的智慧似乎沉淀在了它们之上，数个世纪的知识就隐藏在它们散发出的微弱蓝光之下。

Apart from that, his features were fine, like porcelain and seeming equally fragile; his hands were slim, tapering; his shoulders drooped a little; his skin in general, apart from the freckles of his face, was pale and unblemished. But for the eyes, you probably wouldn't look at him twice on the street. He was just ... a young man. Or a young ghost. Or maybe a very old one.

除开这些之外，他的特征只能说是平平常常，像瓷器般，也同样的脆弱。他的手细长，他的肩膀有点坠，他的皮肤除了脸上的雀斑，可以说是苍白无暇。但是他的眼睛，你绝不会在街上能够再次看到。 他就像是一个……年轻人，或者说年轻鬼，当然也可能是一个老鬼。

'No,' said the object of Kyle's scrutiny, his lips immo&shy; bile, 'I'm not any kind of ghost. Not in the classic sense of the word, anyway. But now, since you obviously accept me, can we begin?'

“不，”凯尔审视的目标说道，他的嘴唇懂了起来：“我并不是任意形式上的鬼魂，至少不是这个词经典定义中的那些。 但是现在，既然那你已经接受了我的存在，我们可以开始了么？”

'Begin? Er, of course!' Kyle suddenly felt like laughing, hysterical as a schoolgirl. He controlled it with an effort.

“开始？呃，当然！”凯尔突然有点想笑，那种校园女生发出的歇斯底里的笑声，但是他努力控制住了。

'Are you sure you're ready?'

“你确定你准备好了么？”

'Yes, yes. Go right ahead. But - er - can I record this? For posterity or whatever, you know? There's a tape recorder here, and I -'

“嗯，是的，开始吧。但，呃，我能够录下来么？这样将来如果有什么事情发生的话，这里就有一份记录，我就……”

'The machine won't hear me,' said the other, shaking his head again. 'Sorry, but I'm only speaking to you - directly to you. I thought you understood that? But... take notes if you wish.'

“那部机器听不到我的声音，”幻影说道，又摇了摇他的头：“抱歉，但是我只在跟你说——直接的跟你说，我觉得你应该能理解这种方式吧？不过……如果你愿意的话，你可以做笔记什么的。”

'Notes, yes...' Kyle scrabbled in the desk drawers, found paper and a pencil. 'Fine, I'm ready.'

“笔记，对……”凯尔在抽屉中翻找着，找到了一些纸和一只铅笔：“好的，我准备好了。”

The other slowly nodded. 'The story I have to tell is ... strange. But working in an organisation such as yours, you shouldn't find it too unbelievable. If you do... there'll be plenty for you to do afterwards; the truth of the things I'm going to tell you will come out then. As to any doubts you may have about the future of your branch - put them aside. Your work will go on, and it will go from strength to strength. Gormley was the head, but he's dead. Now you will be head - for a little while. You'll be up to it, I assure you. Anyway, nothing that Gormley knew has been lost; indeed, much has been gained. As for the Opposition - they've suffered losses from which they may never recover. At least, they're about to.'

幻影缓缓的点了点头，道：“我要告诉你的故事……很离奇。但是在一个这样的部门工作，你应该不会觉得这太难以令人置信。如果你实在觉得难以相信的话……可能之后你需要做一些额外的调查，我所告诉你的事情的真实性是可以被得到证明的。 至于你对部门未来的担忧，你可以暂时将它们放在一边。 你的工作会继续下去，并且会越来越成功。 戈姆利是你们之前的头头，但是他已经死了。那么现在你就会成为你们的头头，至少暂时是这样。 你会习惯这一切的，我向你保证。 总之，戈姆利所知晓的一些都并未丢失；实际上，它们还在不断增殖着。而那些“对头”，他们会遭受难以恢复的损失的。至少，他们正要呢。”

As the apparition spoke, so Kyle's eyes opened even wider and he sat up straighter and straighter. It (he, dammit!) knew about the branch. About Gormley. About 'the Opposition', which was branch parlance for the Russian outfit. And what was this about them suffering heavy losses? Kyle knew nothing of that! Where did this - being - get its information? And just how much did it know anyway?

随着幻影的话语，凯尔的眼睛越睁越大，他也坐的越来越直。它（他，该死的！）知道部门，知道戈姆利，知道“对头”——这是部门内对俄罗斯装备部的称呼。 那么他所说的即将遭受的沉重损失是什么呢？凯尔一点都不知道，这个，东西，是从哪得到这些信息的？他又知道多少东西呢？

'I know more than you can possibly imagine,' said the other, smiling wanly. 'And what I don't know I can get to know - almost anything.'

“我比你想象的知道的还要多，”幻影微笑着说道：“我不知道的我也能去了解——几乎所有的事情。”

'See,' said Kyle defensively, 'it's not that I doubt any of this - or even my sanity, for that matter - it's just that I'm trying to adjust, and -'

“看起来似乎是的，”凯尔回嘴道：“并不是我怀疑这些甚至说我的理智——只是我需要试着调整，并且……”

'I understand,' the other cut him off. 'But, please, do your adjusting as we go, if you can. In what I'm about to tell you, time-zones may overlap a little, so you'll need to adjust to that, too. But I'll keep it as chronologically sound as I can. The important thing is the information itself. And its implications.'

“我理解，”幻影打断道：“但是请让我们先开始，在这个过程中你可以尽你的努力做调整。 在我将要告诉你的事情中，时间会有一些略微的重叠，你肯定也会需要适应这种问题的。但是我会尽我所能按照时间顺序进行描述的。注意，重要的东西在于信息本身，以及它们的含义。”

'I'm not sure I quite under - '

“我不太确定我理……”

'I know, I know. So just sit there and listen, and then maybe you will understand.'

“是的，我知道。所以先坐在那听我慢慢道来，然后你或许就会明白我的意思了。”
