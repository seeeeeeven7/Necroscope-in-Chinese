Prologue

序言

The hotel was big and rather famous, ostentatious if not downright flamboyant, within easy walking distance of Whitehall , and... not entirely what it seemed to be. Its top floor was totally given over to a company of international entrepreneurs, which was the sum total of the hotel manager's knowledge about it. The occupants of that unknown upper region had their own elevator at the rear of the building, private stairs also at the rear and entirely closed off from the hotel itself, even their own fire escape. Indeed they - 'they' being the only identific ation one might reasonably apply in such circumstances - owned the top floor, and so fell entirely outside the hotel's sphere of control and operation. Except that from the outside looking in, few would suspect that the building in total was anything other than what it purported to be; which was exactly the guise or aspect - or lack of such - which 'they' wished to convey.

这家酒店坐落于白厅的步行范围内，它大而著名，即便不过多夸张——它也相当招摇。但是，它并不完全像它看上去那样——酒店的顶层被完全的给予了一家国际企业家的公司，而这也就是酒店经理所知的全部了。这个未知的上层区域被它的占据者们在建筑物的后侧安装了单独的电梯、私人楼梯甚至还有消防通道，并且完全不对酒店本身开放。事实上，他们 - “他们是在这种情况下唯一可以合理应用的称呼” - 完全拥有顶层，所以彻底的脱离了酒店的控制和操作范围。从酒店的外表看来，很少人会怀疑这座建筑物会超脱其本身所表述的那些东西——这正是他们所希望传达的意图，或者说是他们所缺少的。

As for the 'international entrepreneurs' - whatever such creatures might be - 'they' were not. In fact they were a branch of Government, or more properly a subsidiary body. Government supported them in the way a tree supports a small creeper, but their roots were wholly separate. And similarly, because they were a very tiny parasite, the vast bulk of the tree was totally unaware of their presence. As is the case with so many experimental, unproven projects, their funding was of a low priority, came out of 'petty cash'. The upkeep of their offices was therefore far and away top of the list where costing was concerned, but that was unavoidable.

至于“国际企业家” - 无论这个辞藻描述的是什么 - “他们”其实并不是。 事实上，他们是政府的一个分支，或者说附属机构更合适。政府以树木支撑小爬虫的方式支持他们，但他们的根源是完全分开的。同样的，因为他们是非常小的寄生虫，所以树木的大部分躯干完全不知道他们的存在。就像许多实验性、未经证实的项目一样，他们的资金是低优先级，来自“小现金”。因此，他们的办公室的维护成本远远超过了成本核算清单中应当的数额，但这是不可避免的。

For unlike other projects, the nature of this one demanded a very low profile indeed. Its presence in the event of discovery would be an acute embarrassment; it would doubtless be viewed with suspicion and scorn, if not disbelief and downright hostility; it would be seen as a totally unnecessary expenditure, a needless burden on the taxpayer, a complete waste of public money. Nor would there be any justifying it; the benefits or fruits of its being remained as yet entirely conjectural and the mildest 'frost' would certainly put paid to them. The same principles apply to any such organisation or service: it must (a) be seen to be effective while paradoxically (b) maintaining its cloak of invisibility, its anonymity. Ergo: to expose such a body is to kill it...

但是与这些项目不同的是，这个项目的天然属性决定它需要低调，出现在公众视野会使得事情变得十分尴尬。既是不报以彻底的不信任和敌意，它也会被怀疑和蔑视。它会被视为完全不必要的支出、纳税人不必要的负担和公帑的彻底浪费。或者说没有理由去做这样的事情，它的好处和成果仍然处于猜想阶段，所以即使最温和的情况下也会对它报以冷遇。这就是类似组织或服务都面临的困境——首先它需要看起来是有效的，但是矛盾的是，它又需要隐藏起来，保持匿名，因为露出其身躯就是使其灭亡。

Another way to dispose of this sort of hybrid would be, quite simply, to tear up its roots and deny it had ever existed. Or wait for them to be torn up by some outside agency and then fail to replant them.

对于这种矛盾体的一种处理方式是相当简单的——剥夺它的根源、否认它的存在，或者等待它被一些外部机构所拆除，并且无法复原。

Three days ago there had occurred just such an uprooting. A major tendril had been broken, whose principal function it had been to bind the vine to its host body, providing stability. In short, the head of the branch had suffered a heart attack and died on his way home. He had had a bad heart for years, so that wasn't strange in itself - but then something else had happened to throw a different light on the matter, something Alec Kyle didn't want to dwell on right now.

而三天前就发生了这样一件事情，组织的一条主干，一条用来附在宿主躯干上以提供稳定性的藤蔓被斩去了。简而言之，这条主干的头目遭受了心脏病发作，在他回家的路途中死亡，他多年以来心脏不好，所以这并不奇怪——但是对于亚力克·凯尔来说，他不希望这样的事情发生更多了。

For now, on this Monday morning of an especially chilly January, Kyle, the next in line, must assess the damage and feasibility of repairs; and if such repairs were at all possible, then he must make his first groping attempt to pull the thing back together. The project's foundations had always been a little shaky but now, lacking positive direction and leadership, the whole show might well fall apart in very short order. Like a sand-castle when the tide comes in.

现在，这个寒风凛冽的一月的周一上午，凯尔，目前的主管者，必须评估损坏程度以及修理可行性。如果修理是可能的话，那么他必须首先尝试将事情拉回正轨。这个项目的基础一直有点不稳定，但现在，缺乏明确的方向和领导，整个局面可能很快速地崩溃——就像浪潮之下的沙堡。

These were the thoughts in Kyle's head as he stepped from the slushy pavement through swinging glass doors into a tiny foyer, shook damp snow from his overcoat and turned the collar down. It was not that he personally had any doubt as to the validity of the project - in fact the opposite applied: Kyle believed the branch to be all- important -but how to defend his position in the face of all that scepticism from above? Scepticism, yes. Old Gormley had been able to pull it off, with all his friends in high places, his 'old school tie' image, his authority and enthusiasm and sheer get-up-and-go, but men such as Keenan Gormley were few and far between. Even fewer now.

这便是凯尔在他从泥泞的路面经由摆动的玻璃门进入一个小门厅时脑中的想法，随后他从大衣上将潮湿的雪摇落，衣领也拉了下来。凯尔并不是对这个项目的有效性存疑——相反他认为这个项目非常重要，但是对于上面的这些怀疑时，他该如何捍卫自己的立场？是的，怀疑。老戈姆利能够也乐意将他的朋友们捧得高高的——他的“校友情”、权威、热枕以及纯粹的热枕，但是基恩·戈姆利这样的人很少，而且越来越少了。

And this afternoon at four o'clock Kyle wouldbe called upon to defend his position, the validity of his branch's being, its very existence. Oh, they'd been quick off the mark, right enough, and Kyle believed he knew why. This was it, the crunch. With nothing to show for five years' work, the project was to be terminated. No matter what arguments he produced, he'd be shouted down. Old Gormley had been able to shout louder than all of them put together; he'd had the clout, the back-up; but Alec Kyle - who was he? In his mind's eye, he could picture the afternoon's inquisition right now:

这个下午的四点钟，凯尔需要保卫其立场，这个分支存在的有效性还有它的存在本身。噢，它们就要理他而去了。凯尔相信他知道为什么，危机。历经五年的工作，却没有任何可展示的东西，这分支就要终结与此。无论他给出什么样的论据，无论他如何大喊大叫。老戈姆利倒是能比其他人喊得都大声，因为他有影响力，有支持。但是亚力克·凯尔，他又是谁？对他来说，下午的审判仿佛已在眼前。

'Yes, Minister, I'm Alec Kyle. My function in the Branch? Well, apart from being second in command to Sir Keenan, I was - I mean I am - er, that is to say, I prognosticate ... I beg your pardon? Ah, it means I foresee the future, sir. Er, no, I have to admit that I probably couldn't give you the winner of the 3:30 at Goodwood tomorrow. My awareness generally isn't that specific. But -'

“是的，部长，我是亚力克·凯尔。我在分支里的职能？额，除了对基恩爵士报告之外，我是——我的意思是我是，呃，那就是说，我能够预言...您说什么？啊，这意味着我能够预见未来，先生。呃，不，我不得不承认，我可能不能给你古德伍德明天3点30分场的优胜者。我的结论一般不是具体的。但是……”

But it would be hopeless! A hundred years ago they wouldn't accept hypnotism. Only fifteen years ago they were still laughing at acupuncture. So how could Kyle hope to convince them in respect of the branch and its work? And yet, on the other hand, coming through all the despondency and sense of personal loss, there was this other thing. Kyle knew it for what it was: his 'talent', telling him that all was not lost, that somehow he would convince them, that the branch would go on. Which was why he was here: to go through Keenan Gormley's things, prepare some sort of case for the branch, continue fighting its cause. And again Kyle found himself wondering about his strange talent, his ability to glimpse the future.

但是这是毫无希望的，一百年前他们就不接受催眠的存在，十五年前他们就开始嘲笑针灸，那么凯尔怎能寄希望于说服他们分支的存在和它的功能？然而，从另一个角度来说，除开这些沮丧和个人损失都情绪，还有一件事情，凯尔知道它是什么——他的“天赋”，告诉他所有东西都并未失去，不知何故他最终说服了他们，分支会继续下去。这就是他在这里的原因，在基恩·戈姆利的这些事务中走过场，为分支准备一些“案例”，从而继续奋斗其事业。并且凯尔发现他又开始好奇他的天赋，他能够遇见未来的能力。

For the fact was that last night he had dreamed that the answer lay right here, in this building, amongst Gormley's papers. Or perhaps 'dreamed' was the wrong word for it. Kyle's revelations - his glimpses of things which had not yet happened, future occurrences -invariably came in those misty moments between true sleep and coming awake, immediately prior to full conscious awareness. The clamour of his alarm-clock could do it, set the process in motion, or even the first crack of sunlight through his bedroom window. That's what it had been this morning: the grey light of another grey day invading his room, getting under his eyelids, impressing upon his idly drifting mind the fact that another day was about to be born.


事实是，昨天晚上他梦见答案就在这里，在这栋建筑当中，在戈姆利的文档中。或者不应当说梦见，凯尔的奇石——他瞥见未发生的事情，未来的碎片——在真正的睡眠和即将到来的清醒之间，会在迷雾中出现。闹钟的喧嚣可以做到这一点，只需简单的设定一下，甚至通过卧室窗口照进的第一缕曙光亦可。这就是今早所发生的事情，一个灰色的一天所照进的第一缕灰色的光线，入侵他的房间，在他的眼皮下面，在他懒散的脑海中，印下了这即将开始的一天。

And with it had been born a vision. But again, 'glimpse' might be a better word for it, for that wasall Kyle's talent had ever permitted: the merest glimpse. Knowing this - and knowing that it would only occur once and then be gone forever - he had fastened upon it. absorbed it. He dared not miss a thing. Everything be had ever 'seen' in this way had always proved to be vitally important.

而且它生出了一个景象。或者“瞥见”可能是一个更好的词，因为凯尔的天赋所允许仅仅是瞥见。他知道这一点-知道它只会发生一次，然后永远消失，所以他坚持着，吸收着，他不敢错过任何事情。一切都被“看到”，这样被证明了是至关重要的。

And on this occasion:

在这个场合当中：

He had seen himself seated at Keenan Gormley's desk, going through his papers one by one. The top right-hand desk drawer was open; the papers and files on the desk in front of him had come from there. Gormley's massive security filing cabinet stood as yet undisturbed against the wall of his office; its three keys were lying on top of the desk where Kyle had tossed them. Each key would open a tiny drawer in the cabinet, and each drawer had its own combination lock. Kyle knew the combinations and yet had not bothered to open the cabinet. No, for that which he sought was right here, in these documents from the drawer.

他看到自己坐在基恩·戈姆利的办公桌上，一张一张的阅览他的文件。右上角书桌的抽屉开着; 他面前的桌子上的文件和文件来自那里。 戈姆利的大规模安全文件柜还没有受到他办公室墙壁的干扰。 它的三把钥匙躺在桌子上，凯尔把他们扔了。 每个钥匙都会在橱柜内打开一个小抽屉，每个抽屉都有自己的组合锁。 凯尔知道这些组合，但并没有打扰开柜。 不，他所寻求的是在这里，在这些文件从抽屉。



As if realisation of that fact had galvanised the image of himself where it sat in Gormley's chair, Kyle had then seen himself pause abruptly as he came to a certain file. It was a yellow file, which meant that it concerned a prospective member of the organisation. Someone 'on the books', as it were. Someone Gormley had had his beady eye on. Perhaps someone with a real talent.

As that thought dawned, so Kyle took a step towards himself where he sat. Then, dramatically, as was always the case, his alter-image at the desk had looked up, stared at him, and held up the file so that he could read the name on the cover. The name was 'Harry Keogh'.

That was all. That had been the point where Kyle had started awake. As to what the thing had meant or was supposed to signify - who could say? Kyle had long since given up trying to predict the meaning of these glimpses, other than the fact that they had meaning. But in any case, if something could be said to have brought him here today, it would have to be that brief and as yet inexplic&shy; able 'dream' before waking.

As yet it was still fairly early in the morning. Kyle had beaten the first rush of heavy traffic in London's streets by just a few minutes. For the next hour or more all would be chaos out there, but in here it was quiet as the proverbial tomb. The rest of the admin team (all three of them, including the typist!) had been given today and tomorrow off out of respect for the dead man, so the offices upstairs would be completely empty.

In the tiny foyer Kyle had pressed the button for the elevator, which now arrived and opened its doors. He entered and as the doors closed behind him he took out his pass-card, sliding it easily and smoothly through the sensor slot. The elevator jerked but made no upward movement. Its doors opened, waited for a long moment, closed again. Kyle frowned, glanced at his card and silently cursed. It had run out yesterday! Normally Gormley would have renewed its validity on the branch com&shy;puter; now Kyle would have to do it himself. Fortunately he had Gormley's card with him, along with the rest of his office-related effects. Using the ex-Head of Branch's pass-card, he coerced the elevator into carrying him to the top floor, going through a similar procedure to let himself into the main suite of offices.

The silence inside was almost deafening. High up above the level of the street, with soundproofed floors to shut out hotel noises from below and double-glazed, tinted windows for additional privacy, the place seemed set in a sort of vacuum. The feeling crept in that if you listened to that silence long enough, it would become hard to breathe. It was especially so in Gormley's room, where someone had been thoughtful enough to draw the blinds at the windows. But the blinds had jammed only a little more than half-way shut, so that now, with bands of light coming in through the green-tinted windows, the entire office seemed decorated in a horizontal, sub-marine pin&shy;stripe. It made this once familiar room strangely alien, and it was suddenly very odd and unreal not to have the Old Man here...

Kyle stood in the doorway, staring into the office for long moments before entering. Then, closing the door behind him, he stepped to the centre of the room. Several hidden scanners had already picked him up and identified him, in the outer offices as well as in here, but a monitor screen in the wall close to Gormley's desk wasn't satisfied. It beeped and printed up:

SIR KEENAN GORMLEY IS NOT AVAILABLE AT PRESENT. THIS IS A SECURE AREA. PLEASE IDENT&shy;IFY YOURSELF IN YOUR NORMAL SPEAKING VOICE, OR LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU FAIL TO LEAVE OR IDENTIFY YOURSELF, A TEN SECOND WARNING WILL BE GIVEN, FOLLOWING WHICH THE DOOR AND WINDOWS WILL LOCK AUTOMATI&shy;CALLY... REPEAT: THIS IS A SECURE AREA.

Feeling irrationally aggressive towards the cold, unthinking machine, and not a little perverse, Kyle said nothing but waited. After a count of three the screen wiped itself clean and printed up:

TEN SECOND WARNING COMMENCES NOW... TEN... NINE... EIGHT... SEVEN ... SIX ...

'Alec Kyle,' said Kyle grudgingly, not wishing to be locked in.

The machine recognised his voice pattern, stopped counting, commenced a new routine:

GOOD MORNING, MR KYLE... SIR KEENAN GORMLEY IS NOT -

'I know,' said Kyle. 'He's dead.' He stepped to the desk keyboard and punched in the current security override; to which the machine replied:

DO NOT FORGET TO RE-SET BEFORE YOU LEAVE, and switched itself off.

Kyle sat down at the desk. Funny world, he thought. And, funny bloody outfit! Robots and romantics. Super science and the supernatural. Telemetry and telepathy. Computerised probability patterns and precognition. Gadgets and ghosts!

He reached into a pocket for his cigarettes and lighter, came out with both items and also the keys to Gormley's security cabinet. Without thinking, he tossed the keys on to an empty corner of the desk. Then he paused and stared at them lying there, forming a pattern - the pattern from this morning's glimpse into the future. Very well, let's go from there.

He tried the drawers of the desk. Locked. He took out Gormley's notebook from the inside pocket of his overcoat, checked the code. It was OPEN SESAME.

Unable to suppress a chuckle, Kyle punched OPEN SESAME into the desk keyboard and tried again. The top right-hand drawer slid open at a touch. Inside, papers, documents, files...

And here comes the funny bit, he thought.

He took out the papers and placed them in front of him on the desk. Leaving the drawer open (his 'glimpse' again), he began to check through the documents, placing each one back in the drawer in its turn. He knew that by now his talent shouldn't really surprise him any more, but it always did - and so he gave a small involuntary start as he arrived at the yellow file. The name on the cover was, of course, Harry Keogh.

Harry Keogh. Apart from Kyle's dream, that name had only ever come up once before: in an ESP game he had used to play with Keenan Gormley. As for this file: he had never seen it before in his life (his conscious life, anyway) and yet here he sat staring at it, exactly as in his dream. It was a very creepy feeling. And -
